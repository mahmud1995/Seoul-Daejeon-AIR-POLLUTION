# Seoul-Daejeon-AIR-POLLUTION
This repository is about to study affection of Air Pollution in Seoul and Daejeon
The goal is to explore the relationship between air pollution, specifically Ozone(O3) and Fine Dust, and allergies using a data-driven approeach. 
By analyzing data on antihistamin usage and air pollution levels, we seek to gain insights into the potential correlation between these variables and its implications for public health.

Ozone is a colorless gas that forms when sunlight reacts with pollutants emitted by vehicles, industrial processes, and other sources.
It is a major component of smog and can be found in the Earth's lower atmosphere (troposphere).
High levels of ozone can cause respiratory issues, aggravate asthma symptoms, and contribute to the development of respiratory diseases.
Ozone is a common air pollutant, and monitoring its levels is crucial to understanding its impact on public health and the environment.

Fine dust refers to tiny solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. These particles can vary in size and composition.
The most commonly monitored type of fine dust is particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5).
PM2.5 particles are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the respiratory system and can have adverse health effects.
Fine dust is mainly generated by combustion processes (e.g., vehicle emissions, industrial activities) and natural sources (e.g., dust and pollen).
Exposure to high levels of fine dust can lead to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and other health complications.

Examine the relationship between air pollution and allergies by analyzing antihistamine usage and air pollution data:
By analyzing data on antihistamine usage and air pollution levels, the project aims to understand the potential relationship between air pollution and allergies.
This involves exploring how changes in air pollution levels correspond to variations in antihistamine usage, providing insights into the impact of air pollution on allergic reactions.

Calculate the relative number of prescriptions per capita to understand the impact of air pollution on allergies in two cities: Daejeon and Seoul:
To assess the impact of air pollution on allergies, the project calculates the relative number of antihistamine prescriptions per capita in two cities: Daejeon and Seoul.
This calculation helps determine whether there are differences in antihistamine usage between the two cities and provides an indicator of the prevalence of allergies in relation to air pollution.

Compare the distributions of antihistamine usage data between Daejeon and Seoul using various analytical methods:
The project involves comparing the distributions of antihistamine usage data between Daejeon and Seoul to identify any significant differences.
Analytical methods such as statistical tests or data visualization techniques may be employed to examine variations in antihistamine usage patterns and determine if there are significant disparities between the two cities.

Analyze the correlation between air pollution levels and the relative quantity of antihistamines to identify potential patterns:
By examining the correlation between air pollution levels (specifically ozone and fine dust) and the relative quantity of antihistamines, the project seeks to identify patterns or relationships.
This analysis can reveal whether higher levels of air pollution coincide with increased antihistamine usage, indicating a potential link between air pollution and allergic reactions.
